This is a repository for me to get used to Github

Hello I am a student majored in statistics and I hope being capable to use Github professionally in order to collaborate with my classmates and implement version control.

Before starting, we should open terminal in VS code and enter the information of user

```
git config --global user.name jtangy95
git config --global user.email jtangy95@gmail.com
```

First, if we want to access repository in local computer at first, then we should bring it by `clone`. 
```
git clone URL   # URL given in github repository
```

More easy way to do in VS Code is that press `cmd`+`shift`+`p` to open command palette and enter "Git:Clone"
